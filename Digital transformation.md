Digital Transformation can be defined as the introduction of digital technologies to improve the efficiency of each aspect in the process of manufacturing. digital transformation is often confused with digitization and digitalization but they are different to each other.
Internet of Things, Artificial  intelligence, Machine learning, Data analytics are the major technologies upon which the digital transformation is being built.
# Difference between Digitization,Digitalisation,Digital transformation
## Digitization
Digitization can be defined as the process of changing from analog form to digital form. Conversion of paper documents into scanned documents can be considered as an example of digitization.
## Digitalization
It is the use of digital technology and digitized data to change the way of a work to be done. converting paper documents to scanned documents is one example of digitization, providing accessibility for these documents through a cloud system to improve collaboration and feedback can be an example of digitalization.
## Digital Transformation
As we discussed in the previous pages, digital transformation improves the efficiency and helps achieving desired targets and helps industries to be competitive in market. it allows the coordination of the above-mentioned methodologies and helps any organisation to function efficiently.
# Framework of digital transformation
The framework can be defined as the roadmap of an organisation for digital transformation. For a successful digital transformation, it should follow the below listed steps.
| s.no | Name of step | Tools/steps needed |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 1 | Insights | Create centre of excellence |
| 2 | Powering workforce | Providing modern workplace |
| 3 | Business application | Staff & customer engagement |
| 4 | Data analytics | Analysing of bigdata and business intelligence |
| 5 | Digital innovation | Incorporation of AI,IoT,ML |
| 6 | Transformation enablement | Providing support post production |
## Insight to Transformation
More than a technology, digital transformation is a strategy, that requires organizations to review its existing business model, and adopt a new way to bring people, data and processes together. This consist primarily of the below tasks.
1. Setting up a centre of excellence.
2. Creating a prototype of the application
3. Upscaling the innovation
## Powering Workforce
The requirement of this phase is to empower the employees by providing them with the modern workplace tools. Examples are,
1. Implementation of office 365 and training employees in it. This improves the efficiency and communication between them.
2. Implement and train employees on cloud technologies such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) and MS Azure.
## Business Application
This phase provides an interaction between the customers and employees of an organisation for better customer experience and feedback. This improves the relationship between the organisation and the customer resulting better trust and loyalty.
## Analytics
This is the phase where the organization should work on collection of data. Upon their analysis they should get insights, consequently making decisions on the strategy and aspects on digital transformation.
## Digital Innovation
Study of integration of different digital technologies and optimising the required technologies as per the organisation needs is the requirement of this phase.
## Transformation Enablement
As we can see the last phase of digital transformation, is the application of digital transformation into the process. This includes post enablement support, optimization etc., for long term operation and maintenance.
# Need of digital transformation in manufacturing 
The first and foremost need of Digital transformation in manufacturing is to improve the efficiency of the process. Here process does not mean only the manufacturing it include R&D, marketing, the after sales and whatever it takes to produce and maintain a product.
  
Industries today are facing a tough competition from their competitors and they must overcome the challenges to stay in the market. Digital transformation helps companies to overcome the challenges and ensure they are progressing in market.
 
Digital transformation enables industries to work on an agile environment which makes them compatible with different requirements from customers. This adaptation of agile methodology has changed the perception of customers about the multi-channel availability. 
 
The amount of data that is available to the industry are very high today. With the suitable application and with proper analysis of data, industries can make valuable and quick decisions.
 # Conclusion
 From this paper we have come to know that digital transformation is an organisational approach for any organization, which adopts digital technologies to improve on their key performance activities, by having customer satisfaction at its heart.
 
We also understood that the role of data analysis with proper tools and methods helps organisations to be ready for various customer requirements and providing them what they need. Providing organization-customer interactions resulting improvement of mutual relationship.

It must be noted that not just only the enablement of digital transformation can improve the efficiency, lead time and processes. It should be effective and we discussed the different phases of an effective enablement of digital transformation.
